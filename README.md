# **Amazon Web Scraping Project using Python**
This is a simple Python-based web scraping project that imports product data from the Amazon.in website. The program extracts product information such as name, price, weight, and description and gives result in a tabular format. The script is designed to showcase basic scraping techniques with **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests**. It can be expanded to include additional features like saving scraped data to a file or exporting to formats like CSV or JSON.

# **Requirements:**
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:
1. Datetime: To import the current date and time.
2. Requests: To make HTTP requests to the Amazon website.
3. BeautifulSoup: To parse and scrape data from the Amazon product page.

# **Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Input an Amazon.in product URL when prompted and press Enter.(Note: The program may not work for other Amazon websites like Amazon.com due to potential differences in their page structures.)

# **Limitations:**
1. This project is intended for educational purposes only. Please ensure you comply with Amazon's terms and conditions when using this script.
2. Amazon may block your IP if scraping is performed too frequently. Use the script responsibly to avoid potential issues.
3. The program may need adjustments if Amazon changes the structure of its website. The scraping logic depends on the current HTML structure, which could change over time.
